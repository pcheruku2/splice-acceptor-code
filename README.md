# Tandem Splice Acceptor Project

Interpretation of clinically relevant variation challenges genomic medicine practice. Focusing on the creation or disruption of tandem splice acceptor sites (AG variants), we present here programming code and scripts that helped with analysis of the reference genome and public databases. 

The programming code and scripts are organized into 5 folders
```
1. Background_frequency
2. Making_SAR_bedfiles
3. Polypyramidine_track
4. RNASeq_validation
5. Trimer_search
```
