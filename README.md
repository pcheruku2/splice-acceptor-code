# Tandem Splice Acceptor Project

Interpretation of clinically relevant variation challenges genomic medicine practice. Focusing on the creation or disruption of tandem splice acceptor sites (AG variants), we present here programming code and scripts that helped with analysis of the reference genome and public databases. 

The programming code and scripts are organized into 5 folders:

1. Background_frequency: Calculate the background (from the human genome reference sequence GRCh37/hg19) frequency of each trimer
2. Making_SAR_bedfiles: Define the Splice Acceptor Region (SAR) Window from GRCh37/hg19 and generate bed file
3. Polypyramidine_track: Define and generate Transcripts PolyPyrimidine Tract data.
4. RNASeq_validation: 
5. Trimer_search: Search and generate counts for each trimer from .fa file
